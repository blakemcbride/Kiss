This was an effort to move to asciidoc.  

The HTML version looks very nice and the
source is easy to generate.
Also, this is a much more popular format these days.
Lastly, the toolchain is small.

The problem was that the PDF version is really poor.
I couldn;t get the title page right or the table of contents.

I am giving up for now.
