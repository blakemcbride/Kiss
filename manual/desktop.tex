@chapter Desktop Applications

Although there are no specific instructions, portable desktop
applications can be built utilizing @emph{Kiss} in conjunction with
Electron (@uref{https://electronjs.org}).  These
applications would be portable to Linux, Mac, Windows, and other
platforms with a single codebase.

@emph{Kiss} would provide the back-end portion of the application as a
local server and could be written in Java, Groovy, or Lisp.  

The front-end portion of @emph{Kiss} would be used in conjunction with
@emph{Electron} in @emph{HTML}, @emph{CSS}, and @emph{JavaScript}.

The two halves would communicate locally and operate as a standard
desktop application.

If there is interest, please contact this author for assistance.
