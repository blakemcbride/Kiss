Although not a part of the @emph{Kiss} system, there are some very valuable technologies and libraries that
have been used with @emph{Kiss} in order to create some very powerful solutions.

The first is the Lovefield library that adds SQL capabilities on the brower side.  Data is persisted on the user's browser
and remains through browser or machine re-boots.  The library is located at @uref{https://github.com/google/lovefield}

A recent technology that has been used to enable browser application that run when there is no Internet connection
is calles @emph{Service Workers}.
