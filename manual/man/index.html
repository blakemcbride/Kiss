<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>The <em>KISS Framework</em> is an application development framework for
developing web-based business applications.  The main home for <em>Kiss</em>
is <a href="https://github.com/kiss-web/Kiss">https://github.com/kiss-web/Kiss</a>
</p>

<p>Kiss&rsquo; focus is on
simplicity and development speed.  By being simple to develop in,
development and support of the application can occur more rapidly.
Simplicity is achieved by abstracting away as much common
functionality as possible so that developer lines of code are
maximally for the application solution rather than infrastructure and
support of the framework.  Throughout the framework, business-normal
defaults have been employed in order to minimize commonly needed
functionality.
</p>
<p>Another goal of the <em>Kiss</em> framework is to be a complete web-based
application development solution.  <em>Kiss</em> isn&rsquo;t a browser solution
alone, nor is it a back-end solution.  <em>Kiss</em> includes solutions for
both ends &ndash; although the two sides may largely be used independently.
</p>
<p><em>Kiss</em> attempts to create a consistent interface.  This can greatly
simply code even in simple cases.  For example, in terms of an input
text control, why would you disable/enable it with:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$('#id').prop('disable', false);
$('#id').prop('disable', true);
</pre></div>

<p>and then hide/show it with:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$('#id').hide();
$('#id').show();
</pre></div>

<p><em>Kiss</em> provides a consistent interface.  With <em>Kiss</em>, you would do:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">$$('id').disable();
$$('id').enable();
$$('id').hide();
$$('id').show();
</pre></div>
    
<p><em>Kiss</em> is designed to be simple to get started with, simple to learn,
and simple to use.  <em>Kiss</em> does this while supporting important
technologies such as micro-services, front-end components, and SQL.
</p>
<p>The term <em>single page application</em> has several, subtly different,
meanings.  One meaning is that the entire application code is bundled
into a single file or HTTP GET request.  In that sense, <em>Kiss</em> is not a
single page application.  This makes no sense for a business
application that could have hundreds of screens.
</p>
<p>Another meaning of the term <em>single page application</em> is that there is
only a single <code>html</code> tag and all of the remaining pages are
modifications of the original <code>html</code> tag contents.  In this
sense, <em>Kiss</em> is a <em>single page application</em>.  <em>Kiss</em>
applications lazy-load as needed.  Browser cache is leveraged to
minimize Internet traffic.
</p>
<p><em>Kiss</em> is used in a production environment and built by someone with
more than 30 years experience as a framework designer and a business
application software engineer.  So <em>Kiss</em> is not a proof of concept.
</p>
<p><em>Kiss</em> was built as a solution to the challenges faced by the author
when developing web-based business applications.  As such, <em>Kiss</em> is
more a solution for business application development than for the
development of public facing company presentation web sites.
</p>
<p>Another goal of <em>Kiss</em> is to keep the front-end and back-end as
independent of each other as possible.  To this end, communications
between the front-end and back-end occur via REST services and JSON.
This accomplished two things.  First, it allows your organization to be
best prepared for the ever-evolving software environment.  Pieces can
be changed and enhanced without causing massive re-writes of the entire
system.  The second advantage is that by pushing as much processing to
the front-end as possible (rendering the display on the front-end),
the system can better scale.
</p>
<a name="Kiss-Highlights"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.1 <em>Kiss</em> Highlights</h3>

<p>Some highlights of the <em>Kiss</em> system include:
</p>
<a name="Back_002dend-Highlights"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">1.1.1 Back-end Highlights</h4>

<ol>
<li> Micro services - add, change, or delete a web service on a running system.
</li><li> Each web-method is in a single file and are very simple.  No configuration files or setup code needed.
</li><li> Easy access to common SQL databases with support for nested queries without cursor interference.
</li><li> All REST services are stateless.  However, the system fully authenticates each request.
</li><li> Changes to web services occur immediately, on a running system, without the need to reboot the application.
</li><li> A growing class library to handle common business application needs.
</li><li> Back-end framework is written in Java, and the system is portable to Linux or Windows servers.
</li><li> Web services may be written in Groovy, Java or Common Lisp.  Python,
JavaScript, Ruby, and Scala are expected to follow soon.
</li><li> User authentication
</li></ol>

<a name="Front_002dend-Highlights"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">1.1.2 Front-end Highlights</h4>

<ol>
<li> Build your own HTML components thus encapsulating any amount of code into a simple, custom HTML tag.
</li><li> Browser cache control.  Never ask your users to clear their browser cache again.
</li><li> All code written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS.  No need for a complex build and debug process, nor any need to learn yet another language.
</li><li> Growing list of included business oriented components designed to provide simple access to fully functional business components.
</li><li> Straight forward means of designing your own components without a lot of hidden and unpredictable magic.
</li><li> System is small and concise, rather then hundreds of megabytes other systems take up.
</li><li> Consistent and simple API.
</li></ol>

<a name="Back_002dend-Web-Service-Example"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">1.1.3 Back-end Web Service Example</h4>


<p>The following example depicts a complete back-end web service.  The
path to the file is its URL.  The class name is the web method name.
</p>
<p>The file is a text file, but compiled code gets executed.
Authentication occurs before <code>main</code> is called.
</p>
<p>Simply drop the file in place and the web service and method become
immediately available on a running system.  Changes to the service
take effect immediately (no need to reboot the server app).  There are
no configuration files or other code that needs to be changed.
</p>
<p>For example, the following file is located in the
<code>my/web/service</code> directory.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">class MyWebMethod {
    static void main(JSONObject injson, JSONObject outjson) {
        int num1 = injson.getInt(&quot;num1&quot;);
        int num2 = injson.getInt(&quot;num2&quot;);
        outjson.put(&quot;result&quot;, num1 + num2);
    }
}
</pre></div>

<a name="Front_002dend-Web-Service-Usage-Example"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">1.1.4 Front-end Web Service Usage Example</h4>

<p>The following front-end example utilizes the web service defined in the
previous sub-section.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var data = {
    num1:  22,
    num2:  11
};
Server.call(&quot;my/web/service&quot;, &quot;MyWebMethod&quot;, data).then(function (res) {
    if (res._Success) {
        var result = res.result;
        //...
    }
});
</pre></div>
    
<a name="HTML-component-usage"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.2 HTML component usage</h3>
   
<p>To use a component add to HTML:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;my-component&gt;&lt;/my-component&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Add to JavaScript:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">utils.useComponent('MyComponent');
</pre></div>
    
<p>The component can put any HTML in the component location, have any
functionality, have its own modal windows, and use other components.
The component can have custom and non-custom attributes (like style).
Non-custom attributes do what you&rsquo;s expect them to do.
</p>
<p>The system also supports tag-less components.  This provides an easy
way to package arbitrary blocks of code (that can have screens too).
</p>
<a name="System-Maturity-And-Future"></a>
<h3 class="section">1.3 System Maturity And Future</h3>

<p>Largely, the Kiss system, in the form of running applications, has
been used in production environments for a few years.  The effort to
tease away the generic parts and generalize them is recent (2018).
Moving forward, as time permits, the priorities are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Improve documentation
</li><li> More examples
</li><li> Greater front-end functionality (modal windows, grid control, etc. - note that these can be done by any other known facility.  They just don&rsquo;t come included with Kiss yet.)
</li><li> Support more back-end languages (such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.)
</li></ol>

<a name="System-Setup"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">2 System Setup</h2>


<a name="Pre_002drequisites"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.1 Pre-requisites</h3>

<p>You should download and install the following pre-requisites.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Java JDK 8 from <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html">https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html</a>
</li><li> Gradle from <a href="https://gradle.org">https://gradle.org</a>
</li><li> An SQL database server (e.g.&nbsp;PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, SQLite)
</li><li> IDE (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ</a>, Netbeans, eclipse)
</li><li> GIT source code control system
</li></ol>

<p>The system was built and tested with JDK 8, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ</a>, and 
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org">tomcat</a>.  Other environments such as IIS, Glassfish, eclipse, should work fine but may require some configuration.
</p>
<p>Install the above per their instructions.
</p>
<p>With the proper plugins, all of the IDE&rsquo;s can import the Gradle build files.
</p>
<a name="Download-Kiss"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.2 Download Kiss</h3>


<p>Kiss is located at <a href="https://github.com/kiss-web/Kiss">https://github.com/kiss-web/Kiss</a>
</p>
<p>It can be downloaded via the following command:
</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/kiss-web/Kiss.git</code>
</p>
<a name="Setup-And-Configuration"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.3 Setup And Configuration</h3>


<p>Given that Kiss is for business applications, it authenticates its
users.  In order for this to work, there must be a database of valid
users.  This information is persisted in an SQL database.  Therefore a
database will need to be created.  As shipped, the system comes
configured as follows:
</p>
<table>
<tr><td>Database type</td><td>PostgreSQL</td></tr>
<tr><td>Host</td><td>localhost</td></tr>
<tr><td>Database</td><td>kiss</td></tr>
<tr><td>Database user</td><td>postgres</td></tr>
<tr><td>Database user password</td><td>postgres</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This can be configured in the file <code>src/main/application/KissInit.groovy</code>
Valid options for the Database type are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> PostgreSQL
</li><li> Microsoft SQL Server
</li><li> MySQL
</li><li> Oracle
</li><li> SQLite
</li></ul>

<p>Support for other databases is easy to add.
</p>
<p>The remaining parameters should be self-explanatory.  Use the format shown in the example.
</p>
<p>Create the database (named &ldquo;kiss&rdquo; above or whatever name you
configured).  After that, you can run the script file <code>init.sql</code>
to create the table and some initial data.
</p>
<p>The default username is <em>kiss</em>, and the default password is <em>password</em>
</p>
<a name="Building-The-System"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.4 Building The System</h3>

<p>The system may be built in several way.  It can be build from the
command line using <em>Gradle</em>, or at can be build from within your
favorite IDE.  Using an IDE has the great advantage of a built-in
debugger.  This section will outline usage of some of these scenarios.
</p>
<a name="Gradle"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.4.1 Gradle</h4>

<p>While not the best choice when in development mode, <em>Gradle</em> is a
good choice when generating the JavaDocs and possibly also when
generating the final <em>WAR</em> file.  <em>Gradle</em> may be used as follows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>gradle javadoc</code></dt>
<dd><p>JavaDocs end up in the <code>build/docs/javadoc</code> directory.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>gradle war</code></dt>
<dd><p>The WAR file ends up in the <code>build/libs</code> directory.  This file can be just placed in the webapps directory of tomcat to deploy.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>gradle clean</code></dt>
<dd><p>Removes all the generated files.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>gradle appRun</code></dt>
<dd><p>Runs a sample server serving up the application.  The system will be
available from your local browser at
<code>http://localhost:8080/Kiss</code>.  Use <code>^C</code> to exit.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="IntelliJ-Ultimate"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.4.2 IntelliJ Ultimate</h4>

<p>IntelliJ is a good IDE.  The free version may be inadequate for
<em>Kiss</em> however.  IntelliJ should be configured with support for
<em>Gradle</em> and <code>tomcat</code>.  You may set it up as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Get a fresh clone
</li><li> If you just entered IntelliJ select &ldquo;Import Project&rdquo;, or if already in a project select New / Project from existing source.
</li><li> Select the file <em>build.gradle</em>
</li><li> Accept all defaults
</li><li> Go to dropdown at the top of intelliJ screen and select Edit Configurations
</li><li> Click the green + in the upper left corner
</li><li> Select <em>Tomcat Server</em> / <em>Local</em>
</li><li> Change the Name to Kiss
</li><li> Click the Deployment tab
</li><li> Click the Green + in the middle of the screen (not the upper left)
</li><li> Select <em>Artifact</em> and then <em>Kiss.war</em> (exploded)
</li><li> Click &quot;OK&quot;
</li></ol>

<p>To run the app in debug mode just click the green bug at the top of the screen.
</p>

<a name="What-Do-I-Do-With-It-Now_003f"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.5 What Do I Do With It Now?</h3>

<p>What you have at this point is the beginnings of your new application.
<em>Kiss</em> is provided as a running and deployable system.  It is
expected that you would modify what&rsquo;s here to suit your application
needs.
</p>
<p>Besides this narrative, you would need the JavaDocs located under the
<code>build/docs/javadoc</code> directory for API specific documentation.
(Which you may also generate via <em>Gradle</em> as described above.)
</p>


<a name="Orientation"></a>
<h2 class="chapter">3 Orientation</h2>


<p>The entire source code comes with the system and is convenient when debugging, however, only a few areas in the system would normally be of concern when building an application as follows.
</p>

<a name="Back_002dend-Application-Files"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.1 Back-end Application Files</h3>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>src/main/application/KissInit.groovy</code></dt>
<dd><p>This file is used to configure the system.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>src/main/application</code></dt>
<dd><p>All other files under this directory represent the application
back-end.  All the files are used and distributed in source form.  The
Kiss system compiles them at runtime but does not save the compiled form.
Updates to files under this directory take affect
immediately on a running system.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="Front_002dend-Application-Files"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.2 Front-end Application Files</h3>

<p>Files under the <code>src/main/webapp</code> directory represent the front-end of the application.
</p>
<p>All files under the <code>src/main/webapp/kiss</code> directory are part of the <em>Kiss</em> system and would normally not need to be touched.
</p>
<p><code>index.html</code> and <code>index.js</code> are also part of the <em>Kiss</em> system and aren&rsquo;t normally modified.
</p>
<p><code>login.html</code> and <code>login.js</code> represent the user login page and would be modified to suit your needs.
</p>
<p>Other directories such as <code>page1</code> represent other user pages and would be the application specific screens you create.  The included <code>page1</code> directory is only an example page.

<a name="Single-Page-Application"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.3 Single Page Application</h3>

<p><em>Kiss</em> applications are single page applications in the sense
that there is a single <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag and all other pages
essentially get placed into that tag on a single page.  However,
<em>Kiss</em> is not a single page application in the sense that the
entire application gets loaded with a single <code>GET</code> request.  This
doesn&rsquo;t make sense for a large business application in which many
hundreds of pages may exist.  <em>Kiss</em> lazy-loads pages as they are
used, and except for browser cache, eliminates them once another page
is loaded.

<a name="Controlling-Browser-Cache"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.4 Controlling Browser Cache</h3>

<p>The user&rsquo;s browser cache can be controlled from the file <code>src/main/webapp/index.html</code>  In that file you will see two lines that look as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">var softwareVersion = &quot;1&quot;;  // version of the entire system
var controlCache = false;   // normally true but use false during 
                            // debugging
</pre></div>

<p>If <code>controlCache</code> is set to <code>true</code>, each time <code>softwareVersion</code>
is incremented all users starting the application will be forced to
load new code from the server and not use their browser&rsquo;s cache.  Once
they download the new version, normal browser cache activity will
occur.
</p>

<a name="Creating-JavaDocs"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.5 Creating JavaDocs</h3>

<p>JavaDocs for the <em>Kiss</em> system may be created by issuing the following command:  <code>gradle javadoc</code> The JavaDoc files end up in the <code>build/docs/javadoc</code> directory.
</p>

<a name="Deploying-A-Kiss-Application"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.6 Deploying A Kiss Application</h3>

<p>The only file needed to deply the application is <code>Kiss.war</code> It
can either be built by your IDE, or at can be build by typing
<code>gradle war</code> at a command prompt.  In the case of Gradle,
<code>Kiss.war</code> ends up in the <code>build/libs</code> directory.
</p>
<p>If using <em>tomcat</em>, <code>Kiss.war</code> should be placed in the <code>webapps</code> directory.  When <em>tomcat</em> starts, it will see the file, unpack it, and run it.  The application will be available at <code>[HOST]/Kiss</code>
</p>
<p>Renaming <code>Kiss.war</code> to <code>ABC.war</code>, for example, will cause the application path to change to <code>[HOST]/ABC</code>
</p>
<a name="Database-Access"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.7 Database Access</h3>

<p><em>Kiss</em> comes with a powerful library for accessing SQL databases.
Code for this is located under <code>org.kissweb.database</code> It is
currently only documented via JavaDocs but examples and documentation
will follow soon.  It is currently being used in production
environments.  This API provides the following benefits:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Automatic connection and statement pooling
</li><li> Vastly simpler API than bare JDBC
</li><li> Handling of parameterized arguments
</li><li> Auto generation of SQL for single record adds, edits, and deletions
</li><li> Auto handling for cases of cursor interference on nested queries
</li><li> Supports transactions out-of-the-box
</li></ul>

<h3 class="section">3.8 Learning The System</h3>

<p>In order to start getting a feel for how <code>Kiss</code> applications
function, in terms of the back-end, look at files in the
<code>src/main/application/page1</code> directory.  With <code>Kiss</code> you can
develop applications in several different languages.  The <code>page1</code>
example shows the same code in all of the suported languages.
</p>
<p>In terms of the front-end, see the example files under <code>src/main/webapp/page1</code>
