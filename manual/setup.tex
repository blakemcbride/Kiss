@chapter System Setup


@section Pre-requisites

You should download and install the following pre-requisites.

@enumerate
@item
Java JDK 8 from @uref{https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html}
@item
Gradle from @uref{https://gradle.org}
@item
An SQL database server (e.g.@ PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, SQLite)
@item
IDE (e.g.@ @uref{https://www.jetbrains.com/idea,IntelliJ}, Netbeans, eclipse)
@item
GIT source code control system
@end enumerate

The system was built and tested with JDK 8, @uref{https://www.postgresql.org,PostgreSQL}, @uref{https://www.jetbrains.com/idea,IntelliJ}, and 
@uref{http://tomcat.apache.org,tomcat}.  Other environments such as Microsoft SQL Server, IIS, Glassfish, eclipse, should work fine but may require some configuration.

Install the above per their instructions.

In addition to the Gradle build files, Kiss comes with IntelliJ project files that may be used out-of-the-box.  Other IDE's can import the Gradle build files.

@section Download Kiss


Kiss is located at @uref{https://github.com/blakemcbride/Kiss}

It can be downloaded via the following command:

@code{git clone https://github.com/blakemcbride/Kiss.git}

@section Setup And Configuration


Given that Kiss is for business applications, it authenticates its
users.  In order for this to work, there must be a database of valid
users.  This information is persisted in an SQL database.  Therefore a
database will need to be created.  As shipped, the system comes
configured as follows:

@multitable {Database user password} {PostgreSQL} 

@item Database type
@tab PostgreSQL
@item Host
@tab localhost
@item Database
@tab kiss
@item Database user
@tab postgres
@item Database user password
@tab postgres

@end multitable

This can be configured in the file @code{src/main/application/KissInit.groovy}
Valid options for the Database type are as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
PostgreSQL
@item
Microsoft SQL Server
@item
MySQL
@item
Oracle
@item
SQLite
@end itemize

Support for other databases is easy to add.

The remaining parameters should be self-explanatory.  Use the format shown in the example.

Create the database (named ``kiss'' above or whatever name you configured).   After that, you can run the script file @code{init.sql} to create the table and some initial data.

The default username is @emph{kiss}, and the default password is @emph{password}
