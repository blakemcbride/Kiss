Kiss IntelliJ - Community Edition

Tried on version 2021.2.3

The Community Version does not support Web applications.  However,
that is not necessary for our purposes.  It's a little inconvenient to
work with but not too bad.  Basically, we'll use the KISS build system
for installing and running tomcat.  We'll then attach to the debug port
available on tomcat.  From there, you'll be able to debug and develop
as normal.

One positive thing about using the Community version is that it is
a lot easier to set up.

Unfortunately, it has been found that not only is JetBrains' Community Edition
less functional than their Ultimate version, it appears to have bugs that do not
appear in their Ultimate version.  This is not due to a lack of updates on
their Community version either since those bugs appear in no Ultimate version.

The file "pom.xml" is only used to describe dependencies to GitHub.
Kiss is not a Maven project.  Unfortunately, most IDE's see the pom.xml
file and assume a Maven project.  For this reason, the pom.xml usually
needs to be deleted before engaging an IDE.


IDE config:

rm pom.xml
From command line:  ./bld libs
Open with IntelliJ
Add Ant build (message in lower right-hand corner)
Unmark top directory as source root
Mark source roots
	src/main/core
	src/main/backend
	builder

	Properties (icon) - de-select “Make build in background”


------------------------

Developing and debugging:

From the command line:  ./bld develop

From the IDE:  Run / Attach to Process / 9000

From the browser:  http://localhost:8000

From here you can develop and debug through the IDE as normal.
Changes you make to the front-end or back-end will take effect
immediately.  No re-builds are necessary.

Be sure to turn off network caching on your browser development console.
