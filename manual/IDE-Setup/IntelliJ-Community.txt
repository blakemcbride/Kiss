Kiss IntelliJ - Community Edition

Tried on version 2021.2.3

The Community Version does not support Web applications.  However,
that is not necessary for our purposes.  It's a little inconvenient to
work with but not too bad.  Basically, we'll use the KISS build system
for installing and running tomcat.  We'll then attach to the debug port
available on tomcat.  From there, you'll be able to debug and develop
as normal.

One positive thing about using the Community version is that it is
a lot easier to set up.


IDE config:

From command line:  ./bld all
Open with IntelliJ
Add Ant build (message in lower right-hand corner)
Unmark top directory as source root
Mark source roots
	src/main/java
	src/main/application
	builder
File / Invalidate Cache


File / Project Structure
	Libraries
		(remove unused libraries)
		Keep or add
			commons-compress
			libs (libs directory)
	Modules
		(remove unused libs)


Ant / Kiss / All
	Properties (icon) - de-select “Make build in background”


------------------------

Developing and debugging:

From the command line:  ./bld develop

From the IDE:  Run / Attach to Process / 9000

From the browser:  http://localhost:8000

From here you can develop and debug through the IDE as normal.
