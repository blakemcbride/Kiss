NetBeans

NetBeans is the most intuitive and easy to use IDE.  Unfortunately,
since it became an Apache project, it has been going through a huge
number of changes.  As of version 12.5, it wasn't able to debug Groovy
code.  Version 12.6-rc1 works!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

12.6-rc1

./bld all
Go into NetBeans
Tools / Plugins / Installed
	Select and activate HTML5, Java SE, Tools, Groovy, Java Web and EE
Tools / Servers
	Add Server
	Tomcat
	Server Location:  .../tomcat
	Catalina Base:  (blank)
	Username: admin
	Password: admin
	
File / New Project
	Java with Ant / Java Web / Web Application with Existing Sources
	Name and Location
		Location:  (root of your app)
		(Remaining defaults are fine) Next
	Server Settings
		Server:  choose the tomcat that comes with Kiss
		Context Path:  /
	Existing Sources and Libraries
		Web Page Folder:  .../src/main/frontend
		WEB-INF Content:  .../tomcat/conf
		Libraries Folder:  .../libs
	Source Package Folders:
		src/main/backend
		src/main/core
		builder

Right-click project root / Properties / Sources
	Source/Binary Format:  JDK 8
	

After this configuration is performed, you can use the IDEâ€™s native
build and debug processes for development. However, bld should still
be used to produce the production WAR file.

In order to enable the ability to put breakpoints in a Groovy file,
you must first bring a Java file up in the editor.  This enables
debugging ability for Java and Groovy.
