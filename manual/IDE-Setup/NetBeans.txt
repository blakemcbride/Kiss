NetBeans

NetBeans is the most intuitive and easy to use IDE.  As of version 15,
while it does work, it is incapable of debugging code that is changed
while the system is running (a key aspect of Kiss).

The file "pom.xml" is only used to describe dependencies to GitHub.
Kiss is not a Maven project.  Unfortunately, most IDE's see the pom.xml
file and assume a Maven project.  For this reason, the pom.xml usually
needs to be deleted before engaging an IDE.

rm pom.xml
./bld all
Go into NetBeans
Tools / Plugins / Installed
	Select and activate HTML5, Java SE, Tools, Groovy, Java Web and EE
Tools / Servers
	Add Server
	Tomcat
	Server Location:  .../tomcat
	Catalina Base:  (blank)
	Username: admin
	Password: admin
	
File / New Project
	Java with Ant / Java Web / Web Application with Existing Sources
	Name and Location

	Server Settings
		Server:  choose the tomcat that comes with Kiss
		Context Path:  /
	Existing Sources and Libraries
		Web Page Folder:  .../src/main/frontend
		WEB-INF Content:  .../tomcat/conf
		Libraries Folder:  .../libs
	Source Package Folders:

Right-click project root / Properties / Sources
	Source/Binary Format:  JDK 8
	

After this configuration is performed, you can use the IDEâ€™s native
build and debug processes for development. However, bld should still
be used to produce the production WAR file.

In order to enable the ability to put breakpoints in a Groovy file,
you must first bring a Java file up in the editor.  This enables
debugging ability for Java and Groovy.
