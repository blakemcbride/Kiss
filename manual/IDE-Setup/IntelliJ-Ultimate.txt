Kiss IntelliJ - Ultimate Edition

Tried on version 2021.3.2


Although the Ultimate (commercial) version of IntelliJ costs money, it
is probably the most powerful, reliable, and best supported IDE.
Kiss works well with it.  On the other hand, like other IDE's,
IntelliJ can be a bit tedious to configure properly.  The following
steps can be used to configure IntelliJ.


From command line:  
	./bld all	[Linux, Mac]
	  -or-
	bld all		[Windows]
Open (not "New Project") with IntelliJ
Add Ant build (message in lower right-hand corner)

Right-click on "Kiss" at the top of the Project pane and select
"Open Module Settings".

Project
	Edit as needed
	Compiler output is unused
Modules
	Remove all modules except "Kiss"
	Sources
		Mark as source
			src/main/backend
			src/main/core
		Mark as excluded
			build.work
			tomcat
	Dependencies
		Java
		<Module source>
		libs
Libraries
	libs
		(all jar files in the libs directory)
Facets - none
Artifacts - none
Global Libraries - none


Run the front-end and back-end servers by typing the following at the
command-line:

./bld develop		[Linux, Mac]
     or
bld develop 		[Windows]

Attach IntelliJ to the back-end server started with the above command:

	Run / Attach to Process
	(select port 9000)

Back-end code is debugged through IntelliJ.  Front-end debugging
occurs through the browser developer console.  Be sure browser
network caching is disabled.

You can now develop and debug.  Front-end changes will take affect on
page reload.  Back-end changes take effect immediatly.  Just be sure
you have browser caching turned off on your browser development
console.
