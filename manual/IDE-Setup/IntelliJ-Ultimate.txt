Kiss IntelliJ - Ultimate Edition

Tried on version 2021.2.2


Although the Ultimate (commercial) version of IntelliJ costs money, it
is probably the most powerful, reliable, and best supported IDE.
Kiss works well with it.  On the other hand, like other IDE's,
IntelliJ can be a bit tedious to configure properly.  The following
steps can be used to configure IntelliJ.


From command line:  ./bld all
Open (not "New Project") with IntelliJ
Add Ant build (message in lower right-hand corner)
Right-click on project root / Mark directory as / Unmark as Source Root
Right-click on the following directories and mark as Sources Root
	src/main/java
	src/main/application
	builder
File / Invalidate Cache


Configure IDE for tomcat.
    File / Settings / Build, Execution, Deployment / Application Servers
    Click the + in the upper middle of the popup, and then select Tomcat Server
    The home and base should both be set to the root of the tomcat directory that
    is part of Kiss. This will be an absolute rather than a relative path.
    Name it "Kiss Tomcat"

		Remove build

Start the front-end server that comes with Kiss from the command line:
	./serve
	

You can now develop and debug.  Front-end and back-end changes with take affect on
page reload.  Just be sure you have browser caching turned off on your browser
development console.
