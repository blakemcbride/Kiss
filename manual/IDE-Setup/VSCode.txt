Visual Studio Code (VSC) (also VSCode or VS Code)

I was unable to get VSCode's debugger to understand that I was re-loading
code.  Therefore, VSCode is not a good IDE for developing Kiss apps
(unless you can figure it out).

Portable, free, open-source IDE from Microsoft
Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

Written in Electron - JS, CSS, HTML

To run:  code .

Stores files in ~/.vscode and ~/.config/Code

Completely reset vscode:  rm -rf ~/.vscode ~/.config/Code

The file "pom.xml" is only used to describe dependencies to GitHub.
Kiss is not a Maven project.  Unfortunately, most IDE's see the pom.xml
file and assume a Maven project.  For this reason, the pom.xml usually
needs to be deleted before engaging an IDE.

JDK 11 is required for some of the extensions to VSCode.

Install extensions:
	Extension Pack for Java
		Language Support for Java(ï¿½) by Red Hat
		Visual Studio IntelliCode
                Debugger for Java
	Java Decompiler
	Groovy
	code-groovy
	HTML CSS Support
	IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML
	JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly

Add a run configuration for VSCode that looks like this:
        {
            "type": "java",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "Attach by Process ID",
            "processId": "${command:PickJavaProcess}",
            "hostName": "localhost",
            "port": 9000
        }

Start system from command-line:
    ./bld develop

Run "Attach to Process ID" that we just added.
