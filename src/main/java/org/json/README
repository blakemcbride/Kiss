This is a Java library for dealing with JSON objects.

This is a fork of https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java
by Blake McBride

It fixes certain problems with the library.  Pull requests were
not accepted because it would break old code.  I've just decided
to support my own version from this point forward.

Corrections to the original library:

1.  

JSONObject.put("key", 'x');
and
JSONObject.put("key", (Character) 'x');

used to give different results. The first one would treat 'x' as in
int. My change makes them work the same (treat as a character not an
int).


2.  

JSONObject.put("key", null) used to remove the key!!  I changed it to 
create a json key with a null value.

3.

Created a build.sh build script
(what you need to build json.jar)

4.

Enhanced .gitignore

5.

Changed getString to return null when the JSON has a null.
