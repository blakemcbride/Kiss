                <b><i>Kiss</i></b> comes as a very basic running application. Since the
            front-end and back-end can be changed while the system is running, it
            is intended that a developer would start with this basic application
            and build it into the desired application.
            </p>
            <p>
            The basic application the system comes with does not represent the
            kind of application that can be built with <b><i>Kiss</i></b>. It is
            intentionally kept basic so that it is easy to see how it works.  In a
            real application, all the possibilities made available with
            <i>HTML</i> and <i>CSS</i> are at your disposal without limitation. In
            other words, the only limitations to the sophistication of the
            application are your imagination and the amount of work you're willing
            to put into it.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b><i>Kiss</i></b> comes with a complete front-end framework that includes
            most of the things needed for a modern business web application. In
            fact, it is currently being used as the sole framework in some very
            large production systems.  It works well. However, there is nothing in
            <b><i>Kiss</i></b> that prevents you from using other front-end frameworks such as
            <i>React</i>, <i>Angular</i>, <i>Vue</i>, etc. In fact, except for
            dealing with web services and authentication, you could exclusively
            use your preferred front-end framework.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <b><i>Kiss</i></b> back-end is a complete back-end. It is currently
            being used by large web applications involving many hundreds of
            screens and SQL tables and thousands of users. The <b><i>Kiss</i></b>
            back-end contains many built-in features to efficiently handle many,
            many simultaneous users. Like the front-end, the <b><i>Kiss</i></b> back-end
            is designed to be as simple as possible to build production-quality
            web applications. For example, a web service can be built with a single
            source file containing just a handful of lines of code. Everything in
            <b><i>Kiss</i></b> is designed to be simple to understand, simple to use, and
            yet be fully compiled and run at top speed.
