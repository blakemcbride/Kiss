# This file controls what Groovy files in this directory get run.
# The format is the same as the Unix crontab file.
# To see docs run on Linux or Mac:  man 5 crontab
#
# In particular, each line in this file specifies when particular Groovy files get run.
# Each Groovy file must exist in this directory (application/CronTasks).
#
# Format of this file.
#
# Blank lines or those beginning with "#" are ignored comment lines.
# Each non-comment line specifies all of the parameters for a single Groovy command.
#
# The  format of a cron command is very much the V7 standard, with a num‐
# ber of upward-compatible extensions.  Each line has five time and  date
# fields,  followed by a command, followed by a newline character (’\n’).
# The fields may be separated by spaces or tabs.
#
# Commands are executed when the minute, hour, and month of
# year fields match the current time, and when at least one of the two
# day fields (day of month, or day of week) match the current  time
# Cron once every minute.
#
# The time and date fields are:
#
#        field          allowed values
#        -----          --------------
#        minute         0-59
#        hour           0-23
#        day of month   1-31
#        month          1-12
#        day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
#
# A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for ‘‘first-last’’.
#
# Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated with a
# hyphen.   The  specified  range is inclusive.  For example, 8-11 for an
# ‘‘hours’’ entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.
#
# Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by
# commas.  Examples: ‘‘1,2,5,9’’, ‘‘0-4,8-12’’.
