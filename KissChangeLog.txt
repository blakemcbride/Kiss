Kiss Framework Change Log

This file is designed to serve two purposes:

1. Provide a more detailed description of changes to the system than
just the git log.

2. Provide details you may need to upgrade the system beyond what is documented in the manual under
Kiss Framework Updates (2.12).

	Changed how you configure the system.  In the past,
	configuration was done in the file named
	src/main/backend/KissInit.groovy.  That process has been moved
	to a file named src/main/backend/application.ini.  When
	upgrading the system, you will need to manually reconcile
	those two files between the virgin clone and your application.
	
	Added the ability to support one-way hash Sha256 encrypted
	passwords.  The system is backward compatible with
	non-encrypted passwords.  Both are supported simultaniously.
	However, you must extend the length of the password column in
	the database to 64 characters.
	
	Since there is no code in Kiss to add users, you will need to
	encrypt the passwords before you write it to the SQL column.
	You can do this from Groovy with password.sha256().
	
	Updated ag-grid library.  No user changes should be required.

	Updated the upgrade procedure and associated docs to make the
	upgrade process easier.
